        <h1>Types of error messages</h1>
        <p>According to Jakob Nielsen - an acknowledged usability consultant, named the “guru of Web page usability”, an error message is "a system-generated interruption to the user's workflow that informs the user of an incomplete, incompatible, or undesirable situation according to the system's implementation".</p>
        <p>In other words, an error message is a piece of text on visuals or graphics that tells the users that the action they took did not succeed or there are some obstacles in proceeding with the task.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is quite explanatory, presenting the steps that the user should take to proceed with his or her task to resolve the issue. However, there may happen messages like these:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/oops_r.png" title="oops image" alt="oops image" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { width: 400px;height: 200px; }" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/wrong_message_r.png" title="wrong message image" alt="wrong message image" />
        </p>
        <p>making your users frustrated because they are vague, and don't explain what to do next. </p>
        <p>There are four main types of error messages:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="Error.htm">Error</MadCap:xref>
        </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="Confirmation.htm">Confirmation</MadCap:xref>
        </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="Notification.htm">Notification</MadCap:xref>
        </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="Warning.htm">Warning</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Let's be honest, how much of your attention while creating new software do you pay to the possibility that the errors will occur? You probably mostly concentrate on the part that goes well and not on the part that may go wrong.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, you build a product for the customer who will spend quite a lot of money on it, and if so, bear in mind that errors are inevitable. To make the product more customer-friendly, you need to prepare well-written and efficient error messages.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, in this manual you will find many useful tips and ideas how to handle the problem of errors so that the users can feel satisfied while using your product.</p>
