        <h1>Warning</h1>
        <p>A warning message is a notification that alerts users about a potential issue, error, or important information related to a software application or system. It's typically displayed on a computer screen, mobile device, or any other interface to inform users about something that requires their attention or action.  They prevent users from proceeding with the task without being aware of potential risks or consequences.</p>

        <p>The fundamental idea of warnings is that they involve the risk of losing one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>a valuable asset, such as important financial or other data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>system access or integrity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>privacy or control over confidential information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>user's time (a significant amount, such as 30 seconds or more).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
