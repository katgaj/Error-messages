        <h1>Slips and mistakes</h1>
        <p>Jakob Nielson distinguishes between two types of errors: <b>slips</b> and <b>mistakes</b>.</p>
        <p>Slips are unintentional (right intent, wrong action), while mistakes are described as wrong intent. A slip may happen to both experienced and inexperienced user. It can be a spelling mistake or putting data in the wrong box. They come up when the user is not paying attention to their actions, or they are doing their tasks on autopilot. Slips are easy to eliminate: just write the word correctly or put the number in the correct field.</p>
        <p>Mistakes are committed intentionally in a situation when the user does not understand how the product works and makes mistakes to figure out how to complete the process.</p>
        <p>Wojciech Aleksander in his book “UX Writing. Moc języka w produktach cyfrowych” adds to the above types <b>technical errors</b> that may arise due to programming mistakes, issues with network infrastructure or incompatibility between software components, hardware devices, or different versions of the same software.</p>
