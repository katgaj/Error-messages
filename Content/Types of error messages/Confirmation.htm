        <h1>Confirmation</h1>
        <p>A confirmation message is a response or feedback provided to a user to acknowledge that their action has been successfully completed. It confirms that the system has received and processed the user's input or request as intended.</p>
        <p> Confirmation messages are commonly used in various contexts, such as:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>form submissions: after a user fills out and submits a form on a website or application, a confirmation message confirms that the form has been successfully submitted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>transactions: in e-commerce or banking applications, a confirmation message is displayed after a purchase or financial transaction to confirm that the transaction has been processed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>account actions: when users perform actions such as creating an account, updating profile information, or changing settings, a confirmation message confirms that the action has been completed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>deletions or modifications: when users delete or modify content, such as files, messages, or settings, a confirmation message ensures that they are aware of the action and confirms their decision.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Confirmation messages provide reassurance, reduce uncertainty, and prevent errors or misunderstandings.</p>
