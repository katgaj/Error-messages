        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>All in all, creating an exceptionally useful and intuitive software or an  app is undoubtedly your primary goal as a software developer. However, remember about the user experience. According to Nielsen and Norman Group’s research, the websites have improved over the years, yet users’ satisfaction ratings have remained the same. They present two reasons for that state of things:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>UX failures count more than UX successes - it is closely connected with the phenomenon of the negativity bias. It is scientifically proved that humans tend to remember negative experiences more than the positive or neutral ones</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>people judge a site by comparing it with other sites that they’ve encountered.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In usability studies, it's typical for people to stay silent if the user interface meets their expectations. They don't give feedback or acknowledge a smooth experience, regardless of the effort put in by the UX team and developers. But if the interaction doesn't meet their expectations, they become critical and remember the incident for a long time.</p>
        <p>That is why it is so important to work strenuously on your error messages. Your company wants to sell a product. If the product is not user-friendly as far as the error messages are concerned, they will most likely reject it.</p>
