        <h1>Efficiency guidelines</h1>
        <p>Good error messages should explain the erroneous situation but also  protect the user's effort and time. Offer accelerators such as keyboard shortcuts or touch gestures to resolve the situation or share a bit of instruction to aid users' understanding and hopefully avoid the problem in the future.</p>
        <p>Look at the example of a touch gesture. This  contextual help ensures that users will be interested in the instruction, as it directly applies to their current task. It is useful when the traditional interface did  not work and giving the short, precise hint will accelerate the user interaction.</p>

        <h2>Safeguard against likely mistakes</h2>
        <p>When users make a mistake and receive no feedback, it can create a lot of misunderstanding, wasted effort, and frustration. In the past, mail software would  send the user’s email even though it referred to an attachment they forgot to include. Now, most apps will detect this situation and prompt you with an error message before sending it.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Preserve the user's input</h2>
        <p>Let users correct errors by editing their original action instead of having to do everything over again. For example, in presenting search results, show a search box with the user’s original query terms to facilitate revisions. If no hits were found, let users search a wider scope with a single click.</p>
        <p>Or, like below, display the original text entered into a text field even if it does not match the requirements for that field and allow the user to modify it.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Reduce error-correction effort</h2>
        <p>If possible, predict the correct action and let users pick it from a small list of fixes. For example, instead of just saying “city and zip code don’t match,” let users click on a button for the city that matches the zip code they entered.</p>
        <h2>Educate on how the system works</h2>
        <p>Explain to your users how the system works and how to resolve an error. If additional information is required, use hypertext links to connect a concise error message to a page with supplementary material or an explanation of the problem.</p>
        <p>In this situation, the app communicates what will happen to text placed outside the printable area for a custom shirt.</p>
