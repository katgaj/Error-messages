        <h1>Writing good error messages</h1>
        <p>“The best error message is the one that never shows up” — Thomas Fuchs.</p>
        <p>The basic idea is to think of potential errors during the process of creating the application and not after it is implemented. This will help you prepare different scenarios for various error situations. What is more, you may even be able to eliminate errogenic situations from your product.</p>
        <p>As Wojciech Aleksander, a Polish UX specialist, points out in his "UX writing. Moc języka w produktach cyfrowych", when you write an error message it is best to use inverted pyramid:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/The-inverted-pyramid_r.png" title="the_inverted-pyramid image" alt="the_inverted-pyramid image" />
        </p>
        <p>A good error message should provide a clear explanation of why the issue occurred, some background on what happened, and reassure the reader that the problem is not terrible and can be resolved.</p>
        <p>It should also allow them to correct the issue themselves, if achievable, or  to receive support. Ensure to provide a way out of the error if users cannot fix it.</p>
        <p>To make the users want to interact with your product, prepare your error messages in terms of:</p>
