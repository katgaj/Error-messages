        <h1>The "curse of knowledge"</h1>
        <p>It is a common phenomenon that an individual, who is communicating with others, assumes that they  all share the same background and understanding. This bias is also called by some authors the curse of expertise.</p>
        <p>You cannot assume that the ordinary person is as acquainted with technical jargon as much as you are. Also, they may not have the suitable computer literacy or even may not be literate enough to understand complex messages. It 's better to assume that know-one knows anything. Put yourself in your users' shoes, recall the time when you started learning something completely new. </p>
        <p>Definitely do not write error messages like the one below to users of your shopping application:</p>
