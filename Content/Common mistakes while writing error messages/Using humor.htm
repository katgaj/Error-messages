        <h1>Using humor</h1>
        <p> When you are serious while giving the solution, the user gets the idea that you treat the problem seriously and with adequate attention.</p>
        <p>However, you may use humor is certain contexts, when the error is not critical, for example on 404 page. A well-prepared 404-page matching the design and tone of the company’s website can spare the user frustration and make him a recurring client.</p>
