        <h1>Excessive use of red color</h1>
        <p>While using the red color in error messages seems to be reasonable since it turns the user attention to the problem, the excessive usage of red can evoke a sense of panic in users. It might make them more likely to abandon the process they are engaged in.</p>
        <p>Using red  for error messages may not be universally understood or interpreted in the intended way across different cultural contexts.</p>
        <p>Also, for people with color blindness, especially red-green color blindness, using red alone to signify errors can be ineffective as they may not perceive the color in the same way as individuals with normal color vision.</p>

        <p>Use a combination of visual cues, such as icons, text formatting, and contextual information, to  provide users with a clear instruction of what needs to be done. This ensures that error messages are accessible to all users, regardless of their visual abilities or cultural backgrounds. Additionally, providing descriptive text alongside color-coded indicators can enhance clarity and comprehension for users who may not be able to perceive color accurately.</p>
