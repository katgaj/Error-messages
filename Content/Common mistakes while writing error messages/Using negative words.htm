        <h1>Using negative words</h1>
        <p>Using negative words such as error, mistake, warning, or any other words that can raise the user's feeling of anxiety (illegal, invalid, incorrect are not preferable options either). &#160;Neither do they explain the problem nor give the solution. In these terms they are useless, and yet they may discourage the user from interacting with your company's product.</p>
        <p>Look at below phrases that you should avoid in your error messages:</p>

        <p>Negative words can undermine users' confidence in the system or application. Instead of feeling empowered to troubleshoot and resolve the issue, users may feel discouraged or uncertain about how to proceed.</p>
        <p>Error messages with negative language may give users a negative impression of the product or service. They may consider the application as unreliable or poorly designed if they frequently encounter  errors with discouraging language. And this may create a negative brand image over time. Users may associate the product or service with negative experiences, leading to decreased loyalty.</p>
        <p>Instead of using negative words,  focus on providing clear, constructive, and empathetic error messages to give users confidence that they can do the task. Positive language can help maintain user morale, boost confidence, and promote a more supportive user experience. Additionally, offering solutions or suggestions for resolving the error can empower users and demonstrate the product's commitment to customer satisfaction.</p>
