        <h1>Using uppercase and exclamation marks</h1>
        <p>Using uppercase letters in error messages can be problematic for several reasons:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p><b>readability</b>: text in all uppercase letters is hard to read, especially for longer error messages. It requires more effort for users to get through and understand the message, which can increase frustration and decrease comprehension.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>perceived severit</b>y: capital letters are considered to be rude, and can be interpreted as shouting at someone. The whole experience with the error message is already frustrating for the user, there is no need to aggravate this feeling.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>accessibility</b>: uppercase letters can be particularly difficult to read for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties. Screen readers may not interpret uppercase text correctly, leading to further accessibility issues for these users.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/uppercase_r.png" title="uppercase image" alt="uppercase image" />
        </p>
        <p>The above error message does not look user-friendly compared to this one:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/uppercase_1_r.png" title="uppercase_1 image" alt="uppercase_1 image" />
        </p>
        <p>Avoiding uppercase letters in error messages can contribute to a more readable, consistent, and accessible user experience.</p>
