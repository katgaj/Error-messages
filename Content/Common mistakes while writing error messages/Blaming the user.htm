        <h1>Blaming the user</h1>
        <p> Never blame the user and do not use condescending language. Users are already frustrated when they get an error message.This means you should avoid using phrases like “you did” or “you didn’t” when explaining what went wrong.You create the product, so you are responsible for any mistakes that the user will encounter.</p>
        <p>Avoid messages like these:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/blame_r.png" title="blame image" alt="blame image" />
        </p>
        <p>The user is already frustrated, do not tell them they made a mistake. The better option is to acknowledge that the problem evoked on your side, which is, in fact, true. It is your job to work on the product to eliminate as many error-causing scenarios as possible.</p>
        <p>Instead, do that:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/blame_2_r.png" title="blame_2 image" alt="blame_2 image" />
        </p>
