        <h1>Ambiguity</h1>
        <p>Write error messages in clear and simple language. The user should be able to understand the problem while reading an error message.</p>
        <p>If error messages  simply say "An error occurred" or "Something went wrong" without providing any further details, then they are not helpful. Users cannot do anything to fix the problem, and it badly impacts the experience of the product.</p>

        <p>The user should be able to understand the problem while reading an error message and should get the solution. If the user cannot do anything to fix the problem, it badly impacts their experience of the product.</p>
